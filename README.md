## Description

This repository belong to a backend engineer test

## Analysis requirements

The test requires to build an application that would calculate all employeesâ€™ balances at once every midnight to reflect the balance for the day.

I assume that the number of employees that need to be calculated is very large. Therefore, retrieving all the records at once to perform the calculations is not feasible.

As a result, I decided to use Batch processing techniques to handle this large number of records and I use the Microservices architecture for a scalable and reliable application.

## Infrastructure

![infrastructure](./infrastructure.png)

As you can see, I have 4 difference services:

- API Gateway: Receiving and responding requests.
- Core Service: Processing the core business of Salary Hero, I don't interact with the Core Service.
- Cron Service: Executing tasks on the midnight to find the employees who working on the previous day. The cron job will not take all of the employees, instead it will take a batch of employees, then emit it to the Withdraw service to process.
- Withdraw Service: Calculating the amount of withdraw from each employee. If the employees is very large, I can auto scale this service for a better performance.

Beside that, I have 2 Databases (both of them are PostgreSQL):

- Core DB: Store users table, jobs table, working_day table.
- Withdraw DB: Store the withdraw table, this database can be replicated if necessary.

Messages from API Gateway will be sent to the Message Broker to emit it to the corresponding service, in here, I chose the RabbitMQ - a powerful and reliable broker.
